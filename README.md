# Broadcast Web Backend

Using Zoom's new [Video SDK](https://marketplace.zoom.us/docs/sdk/video/introduction), (a no UI, video, audio, screenshare, chat, and data channel as a service SDK), I built a web app where you can livestream from the web to [Amazon IVS](https://aws.amazon.com/ivs/). Combining the most powerful Video and Livestream platforms, this web app allows you to stream from anywhere, and distribute the stream at scale and in high definition.

Backend powered by AWS [API Gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/),  [Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/), and the [IVS SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@aws-sdk/client-ivs).
